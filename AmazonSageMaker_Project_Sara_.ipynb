            "Si su respuesta es sí, usted está en el lugar correcto. Bienvenido a todos. Mi nombre es Muhammad Sajid. Soy un Arquitecto de Soluciones en AWS. Conmigo, tengo Marcus Ulmefors, Director de Plataformas de Aprendizaje de Datos y Máquinas en Northvolt. Él está aquí para hablar de cómo la primera gigafactoría casera de Europa, Northvolt, está produciendo baterías de espalda sostenibles en su fábrica conectada.Un hábito de mantener abiertas las pestañas de mi navegador. Hay un término especial para esto llamado \"Tab-tsundoku\". Tsundoku es una palabra japonesa para adquirir y acumular libros impulsivamente, sin tener la intención de leerlos. Así que levanta las manos si tu navegador se ve así a diario. Bienvenido al club. (risas) Pero no podemos seguir abriendo nuevas pestañas para siempre. Cualquier cosa que no podamos seguir haciendo para siempre es obviamente no sostenible. Así que no estás aquí para escuchar mis hábitos insostenibles.0 sesión de ruptura, donde aprenderá cómo los clientes de la fabricación están aprovechando AWS en su viaje de sostenibilidad. Permítanme hacerle una pregunta. Levante su mano si usted es responsable de la sostenibilidad en su empresa. (murmullos de audiencia) Esperaba que cada uno de ustedes para levantar sus manos. ¿Sabes por qué? Al igual que la seguridad, la sostenibilidad es responsabilidad de todos. Echemos un vistazo a la agenda. Hoy, usted aprenderá cómo los fabricantes pueden utilizar los datos para ser más sostenibles.¿Ogies que usted puede utilizar para optimizar las operaciones de fábrica? También le mostraré una demostración corta de AWS IoT TwinMaker, y obviamente Marcus de Northvolt compartirá su o su experiencia de utilizar AWS para operar la fábrica conectada. Al final, le dejaré con un poco de llamada a las acciones y los recursos de aprendizaje. Así que estás listo? Mostrar un poco de emoción. ¿Estás listo? - ¡Sí! - ¡Sí! (audiencia vítores) (miembros de la audiencia riñen) - ¿Sabes cuál es la temperatura media de la Tierra? Levante sus manos. Hoy, el av globalLos 20 años más cálidos registrados han sido en los últimos 20 años. Así que la investigación dice que la temperatura global promedio puede subir de tres a cinco grados para finales de este siglo, hasta 2100. Los científicos también nos dicen que tenemos una ventana limitada para hacer avances sin precedentes con el fin de limitar el calentamiento global a 1,5 grados Celsius para el año 2050. Y por qué esto es importante, esto es importante para evitar problemas climáticos graves, incluyendo el calor.Pero mi pregunta es, ¿por qué la temperatura de la tierra está aumentando? Mucho calentamiento global está ocurriendo debido a los gases de efecto invernadero generados por las actividades humanas. Entonces, ¿cuáles son los gases de efecto invernadero? Los gases de efecto invernadero atrapan el calor en la atmósfera terrestre que a cambio, hace que el planeta sea mucho más caliente. Hay muchos gases de efecto invernadero diferentes, incluyendo dióxido de carbono, metano, óxido nitroso.El término colectivo \"gases de efecto invernadero\" también va por el nombre más científico llamado equivalente de dióxido de carbono. Y este es el 50 mil millones de toneladas, o 50 gigatones, que estamos tratando cada año. De estos 50 gigatones, ¿cuánto crees que contribuye el sector manufacturero? Aproximadamente 21%, o aproximadamente 10 gigatones, cada año. Permítanme poner esto en perspectiva. Así que un gigatón es aproximadamente 200 millones de elefantes, si se apilan verticalmente uno encima del otro, se estirarían hasta el final.De ahí que el 10 gigatón sea 10 pilas de elefantes que se extienden de la tierra a la luna, y no tenemos que estar vivos y esperar hasta finales de siglo para ver las consecuencias del cambio climático. Por ejemplo, este año alrededor de 33 millones de personas, incluyendo 16 millones de niños, han sido impactados en mi país natal, Pakistán, por la devastadora inundación causada por el cambio climático. Así que 33 millones de personas, hay más personas que la población combinada de todos los países nórdicos, yAsí que la imagen que ven aquí, esta es la imagen antes de las inundaciones satélite donde se puede ver el lago de agua dulce más grande de Pakistán llamado Manchar. Después de las inundaciones, no hay señales de agua dulce, sólo el agua estancada, contaminada, que es sólo un caldo de cultivo, actuando como un caldo de cultivo para los mosquitos. Como dije, no tenemos que esperar. El futuro ya está aquí.De acuerdo con la AIE, la actividad industrial en el año 2021 fue directamente responsable de la emisión de 9,4 gigatones de CO2. Y por cierto, esto no incluye las emisiones indirectas de electricidad utilizadas para procesos industriales. Según el mismo informe, los combustibles fósiles siguen siendo la fuente dominante de energía para la industria. La industria manufacturera contribuye significativamente a los gases de efecto invernadero, y el uso, y los fabricantes utilizan mucha agua y energía.La primera revolución trajo innovaciones mecánicas, como el motor de vapor, el hilado de algodón, y los ferrocarriles. En segundo lugar trajo la producción en masa a través de las líneas de montaje y electrificación. Tercero, que es mi favorito por cierto, trajoLa cuarta revolución es acercar los sistemas físicos, digitales y biológicos. Y la industria 4.0 está reinventando todo el proceso de fabricación en torno al poder de los datos y la nube. La fabricación es uno de los mayores productores de datos que los clientes pueden utilizar para mejorar los conocimientos para ser más sostenibles y más rentables. Pero, ¿cuál es el desafío?Así que vamos a ver cómo las industrias han estado utilizando los datos, y a dónde van ahora. ¿Está usted al tanto del marco ISA95? Levanten sus manos. Así que ISA95 es el estándar internacional para la integración de sistemas empresariales y de control, que es un modelo tradicional antes de la era de la nube. Tradicionalmente, la tecnología de fabricación se ha dividido en tecnología operativa versus tecnología de la información, donde la tecnología operativa, o OT, se ha centrado en los sensores y software, softwares que supervisan y controlan el proceso de fabricación. Y la tecnología de la información, IT, ha proporcionado la función separada de procesamiento de datos y análisis. Así que el modelo ISA95 consiste en niveles de campo y control y gestión. Los niveles de campo y control consisten en sistemas de control básicos, como control de supervisión y adquisición de datos, o SCADA, y controladores lógicos programables y sistemas de control distribuido. El nivel de gestión consiste en logística empresarial y operaciones de fabricación.Tems como el sistema de ejecución de fabricación, MES, gestión del ciclo de vida del producto, y ERPs. Así que históricamente, este modelo monolítico era bueno antes de la era de la nube y computación de borde. Creó silos de datos, y la integración fue un gran desafío, debido a más de 300 protocolos de comunicación comercial e industrial. Con la arquitectura unificada de comunicación de nube y plataforma abierta, o OPCUA, el modelo tradicional ha evolucionado significativamente, y la división IT-OT se minimiza.En la actualidad, en el tiempo de los encuentros físicos digitales, con mayor potencia computacional y conectividad, la frontera IT-OT es invisible, y las industrias están adoptando arquitecturas de nube de borde híbrido. ¿Y por qué lo hicieron? Para ejecutar el sistema crítico de latencia en el borde cerca del piso de fábrica donde ocurre toda la acción, y enviar volúmenes de datos a la nube para análisis, BI, unPor lo tanto, hay un montón de maneras en la fabricación de los clientes pueden utilizar los datos para ser más sostenibles y más rentables. Voy a compartir sólo algunos ejemplos con usted. Puede reducir las necesidades de electricidad, calefacción y refrigeración de un edificio mediante la detección de ocupación, mejor aislamiento y sistemas de ventilación. Del mismo modo, la actualización a la iluminación LED inteligente en edificios y ascensores puede ayudar a reducir su consumo de energía en hasta 75Por cierto, ¿usted es consciente de que AWS va a ser agua positiva para el año 2030? ¿Y qué significa eso? Significa que AWS va a proporcionar más agua al medio ambiente de lo que consume para sus propias operaciones. Así que, al igual que los humanos, las máquinas ahora pueden decirle lo que están sintiendo en este momento. ¿Se sienten bien o mal? Así, según McKinsey, el mantenimiento predictivo puede aumentar la disponibilidad de la línea de producción en un 5-15% y reducir los costos de mantenimiento en un 18-25%. Con Amazon Monitron, usted puede monitorear y detectarEl monitron es como un reloj inteligente para la máquina. Usted lo pega a una máquina, y usted comienza a obtener datos de temperatura y vibración para esa máquina. Por lo tanto, levante la mano si usted sabe la vida útil media de un equipo de fábrica o un activo. Aproximadamente 18 a 22 años. Y con el mantenimiento predictivo, usted puede mejorar la eficiencia general del equipo, OEE, y la vida útil de una máquina aún más, incluso más de 22 años. Así que la digitalización mejora la seguridad del piso de la tienda como wLos edificios de fábrica pueden utilizar datos de temperatura, calidad del aire y ocupación para mejorar la seguridad y comodidad del personal. Como dije al principio, los datos son el elemento clave para la fabricación sostenible, y hoy en día es posible recopilar volumen y una variedad de datos utilizando IoT industrial. Pero la recopilación de datos es fácil. Realizar valor a partir de datos es un reto. Según el Foro Económico Mundial, el uso eficaz de datos en la fabricación puede hacer que las empresas más sostenibles y más rentables.De manera similar, Forbes recientemente encuestó a más de 400 ejecutivos de fabricación en Estados Unidos y Reino Unido, Reino Unido. Sólo el 44% de los encuestados dijo que los recientes esfuerzos de modernización les han proporcionado datos procesables, mientras que el 19% no ha aprovechado ningún dato interno, voy a centrarme en unos pocos servicios de AWS que hacen un seguimiento rápido de la adición de digitalización a su fábrica, y Northvolt explicará suarquitectura que incorpora aún más aspectos. Y la nube es el catalizador para lograr estas capacidades de la industria 4.0. IoT AWS y servicios de anuncios le permite ingerir datos de IoT industriales para crear capacidades de fábrica inteligentes. Del mismo modo, los clientes industriales pueden aprovechar capacidades de cálculo AIML y analítica virtualmente ilimitadas usando la nube AWS. Así que una manera de obtener información de los datos varados entre las cuatro paredes de una fábrica es extender las capacidades de nube al borde, que está llevando la nube a la edge. Así que hoy en día, las empresas industriales quieren ingerir, almacenar y analizar datos IoT más cerca del punto donde se generan los datos, donde ocurre toda la acción, que es el piso de la fábrica. Así que por qué quieren hacer eso, para permitir el mantenimiento predictivo, mejorar la eficiencia general del equipo y mejorar la seguridad de los trabajadores y aún más cosas. Así que los clientes industriales pueden beneficiarse en gran medida de la ventaja de mantener los datos y calcular locales al entorno de baja latencia.Por cierto, transferir un enorme volumen de datos a la nube también es, económicamente, no muy beneficioso. Así, aquí hay un subconjunto del propósito construido servicios AWS, para apoyar a los clientes industriales para construir capacidades de fábrica inteligentes. Dentro de la fábrica, los servicios de anuncios AWS se comunican con el equipo industrial, recopilando y analizando datos, enviando comandos y ejecutando aplicaciones locales. Las fuentes de datos en el borde pueden incluir sistemas SCADA, convertidores de protocolos de terceros, datos hPuede ingerir datos directamente usando AWS Lambda o AWS IoT Greengrass, o utilizar AWS IoT SiteWise para datos que requieren modelado de activos. Una vez que sus datos están en la nube, puede utilizar Amazon S3 como un lago de datos para almacenar volumen y variedad de datos operativos de fábrica. Así que puede utilizar varios servicios de AWS para enriquecer y analizar los datos. Por ejemplo, los usuarios pueden aplicar herramientas de ciencia de datos, como Amazon SageMaker para proporcionar información de la maquinaria en el piso de la tienda.Con el gemelo digital, usted puede mejorar el gemelo físico a través de información rica de datos y aprovechar infinitas oportunidades para simular cambios proactivos y reactivos. Así que el gemelo digital es un dominio complejo. Si le pedimos a 10 personas que definan lo que es un gemelo digital, podríamos obtener 11 definiciones diferentes. Así que veamos cómo lo define AWS. En pocas palabras, un gemelo digital es una representación digital viviente de un sistema físico que imita la apariencia, el comportamiento y el estado del sistema físico para impulsar los resultados del negocio.Por ejemplo, imagine un gemelo digital de un hogar inteligente, con sensores interconectados, y dispositivos IoT que recopilan datos sobre artículos físicos en el hogar, lo que le permite visualizar y controlar la seguridad, la temperatura de acceso, la iluminación y otros electrodomésticos de forma remota. ¿Por qué hace esto? Lo hace para monitorear y reducir el consumo de energía y agua, y aumentar la salud, seguridad y comodidad de los ocupantes.Para tener un gemelo digital adecuado, necesitas sensores de datos IoT de series temporales, datos de vídeo de fuentes de cámara, y datos de una variedad de otros electrodomésticos, como lavavajillas, lavadoras y lo que tienes. Incluso necesitarías visualización 3D o dibujos 3D de tu hogar para visualizar y operar las cosas en su contexto natural. Y lo que sucede cuando reemplazas tu vieja máquina 4-D con la nueva o¿Cómo actualizar el modelo 3D y traer nuevos datos al sistema? Del mismo modo, ¿qué pasa cuando planeas cambiar todas tus bombillas? Ahora imagina la magnitud del trabajo que se llevará a cabo en la construcción de un gemelo digital de una fábrica. Con AWS IoT TwinMaker, puedes empezar fácilmente con la creación de gemelos digitales de sistemas del mundo real, como edificios, fábricas, equipos industriales y líneas de producción, y utilizarlos en aplicaciones web que los operadores pueden utilizar para monitorear y mejorar las operaciones.Por lo tanto, también puede crear una representación virtual de cualquier entorno físico y combinar los modelos 3D existentes con datos del mundo real. Por lo tanto, ahora puede aprovechar gemelos digitales para crear una visión holística de sus operaciones con menos esfuerzos.un espacio de trabajo, que es un contenedor de nivel superior para su aplicación doble digital. También sirve como un límite de seguridad para gestionar el acceso a la aplicación y sus recursos. Con IoT TwinMaker, obtiene herramientas para modelar su sistema mediante el uso de un modelo de modelo de entidad gráfico de conocimiento. Este modelo de componente de entidad contiene entidades, componentes y relaciones entre estas entidades y componentes. Entonces, ¿cuáles son las entidades? Así que las entidades son representaciones digitales del elemento en un gemelo digital.Estos componentes proporcionan datos y contexto para la entidad asociada con la ayuda de conectores, y usted puede tener un montón de diferentes tipos de conectores. Puede utilizar conectores de construcción o crear sus propios conectores si es necesario. Del mismo modo, puede utilizar modelos y dibujos 3D existentes combinados con entidades y componentes para aumentar una representación tridimensional de usted.Veamos un TwinMaker en acción. Así que voy a cambiar a la computadora portátil donde ya he grabado una demo. Así que aquí, ven que estoy conectado a la consola AWS, y ya he configurado un par de espacios de trabajo en el IoT TwinMaker. Así que déjame mostrarte una de las demos llamadas CookieFactory que está disponible en el GitHub para ti que puedes usar e implementar dentro de tu cuenta. Así que empecemos con esta demo. Así que, como puedes ver, ya he creado un espacio de trabajoEscena, puedes representar una habitación en tu casa o un piso de fábrica como una escena, incluyendo, puedes tener, por ejemplo, si tienes un edificio, y estás representando un edificio como un gemelo digital, puedes representar un piso entero como una escena, y obviamente, puedes tener tantas escenas como quieras para crear un gemelo digital. Y obviamente hay un montón de entidades pre-creadas para esta demo que puedes usar.Tenemos una jerarquía, por lo que puede tener las entidades parentales hijos, y obviamente he importado un montón de recursos que nosotros, modelos 3D y recursos, que vamos a utilizar para construir este gemelo digital. Entonces, ¿qué tipo de modelos 3D IoT Maker soporta? IoT Maker soporta el formato GLTF y otros formatos binarios. Así que GLTF es un formato de transmisión de lenguaje gráfico, que es muy amigable con la web. Muy bien, así que vamos a abrir la escena de CookieFactory, y se puede ver que todo el piso de fábrica está representado en un entorno 3D, y usted caY puedes ver que estos diagramas 3-D están conectados con la ayuda de etiquetas y mucha otra información. Así que componentes y etiquetas. Así puedes llamar a la etiqueta como ancla también. Así es como conectas el modelo 3-D doble digital con sus datos, ¿de acuerdo? Así también puedes ver que hay una jerarquía entre diferentes entidades. Del mismo modo, puedes ejecutar consultas para tu gemelo digital, IoT TwinMaker gemelos digitales.Y si sus entidades y componentes tienen relaciones, incluso pueden representarlos visualmente.El operador de fábrica no está conectado a la consola IoT TwinMaker, y no están mirando la consola todo el tiempo. Así que utilizan el panel de Grafana. Por lo tanto, los desarrolladores pueden construir la aplicación Grafana para los operadores de fábrica. Por ejemplo, se puede ver en este panel de Grafana, ya hay un montón de paneles allí. Incluso se puede traer la transmisión de vídeo, el vídeo de Kinesis, a través de la transmisión de vídeo de Kinesis para sus operadores de fábrica, para que puedan ver dónde está sucediendo la acción, lo que está pasando.Y aquí se puede ver, uno de los mezcladores en la parte inferior se está volviendo rojo, y podría haber un problema con este mezclador, y el operador de la fábrica puede fácilmente decir dónde existe este mezclador dentro de este piso de fábrica, y cómo pueden realmente utilizar esta información para ayudar a la gente alrededor de este mezclador, para que arPor lo tanto, este CookieFactory está funcionando con la energía de los combustibles fósiles. Quieren mejorar, quieren tener una mejor combinación de energía, y quieren implementar molinos de viento, parque eólico. Y como desarrollador, nuestro trabajo es hacer que esto suceda. Así que lo que vamos a hacer, vamos a crear un gemelo digital de un viento.Así que ya he creado un espacio de trabajo llamado Windfarm, y se puede ver, no hay escena y ninguna entidad creada todavía. Así que lo que voy a hacer, voy a crear rápidamente una entidad, darle un nombre relevante, por ejemplo Windmill 001, y después de crear la entidad, voy a asociar un componente con esta entidad, y este componente es realmente obtener datos de IoT SiteWise. Así que, es por eso que estoy utilizando el conector IoT SiteWise. Y ya he configurado un modelo de activos dentro del IoT SiteWise. Así que lo que quiero esAsí que, ¿cómo se ve ese modelo en este IoT SiteWise? Muy rápidamente.Ahora sabes de qué tipo de pestañas estaba hablando. Todo está en las nuevas pestañas. Así que como puedes ver, el nombre del modelo es Windfarm, y dentro de este modelo de Windfarm, he asociado un activo, que es Windmill 001. Y qué tipo de medidas estoy capturando es la velocidad, que está en rpm. Y estos son los datos simulados que estoy recibiendo de una de las instancias Cloud 9 detrás de la escena.Ya he creado el panel, sólo para ver cómo se ve para los operadores de fábrica, los operadores de planta, como cómo pueden ver, cómo pueden usar el monitor SiteWise para rastrear lo que está pasando dentro de la fábrica.Así que lo que voy a hacer, voy a hacer clic en él y escalarlo al tamaño apropiado, para que puedan ver realmente cómo se ve. De acuerdo, y puede que tenga que hacer zoom un poco porque todavía no es visible.Pero este molino de viento no parece un molino de viento real, es muy oscuro aquí. Así que vamos a traer algo de luz a la acción. Así que lo que yo haría desde la configuración, realmente voy a configurar el preset ambiental y hacerlo neutral. También podría utilizar una luz 3-D en este dispositivo, pero de nuevo, si tienes un montón de gráficos 3-D, no quieres poner luz en cada uno de ellos.Por ejemplo, la etiqueta podría ser una velocidad, podría ser, puedo tener múltiples etiquetas a un modelo de gráficos 3D. podría ser cuántos rpm están pasando, y también podemos adjuntar el shader modelo, para que podamos cambiar el color de ciertos modelos basados en algunos parámetros, algún umbral.Así que lo que voy a hacer, la entidad que hemos creado antes, ese molino de viento 001, lo voy a unir a este molino de viento, y estoy interesado en la propiedad de velocidad, que es por cierto, la única propiedad que tenemos datos que vienen a través de. Y lo que voy a hacer, también voy a adjuntar una regla junto con esto, para que podamos representar este sombreador en varios colores basados en la velocidad del viento.Por ejemplo, si la velocidad es inferior a 100, quiero asegurarme de que esta sombra muestra el color rojo. De manera similar, si la velocidad es mayor o igual a 100, quiero mostrar el color en diferentes colores, mostrar esto aquí en diferentes colores. Por ejemplo, en este caso, elijo el color verde. Así que eso significa que la velocidad del viento es lo suficientemente buena, y estamos recibiendo buena electricidad. De acuerdo, aparte de eso, también podemos crear cámaras virtuales que apunten a ciertos dispositivos, y podemos have cámara virtual, digamos, en cada habitación de la fábrica o un edificio, para que los operadores puedan llegar directamente a ese lugar muy rápidamente. No tienen que desplazarse realmente y, ya sabes, navegar por el entorno 3D. Así que puede tener un montón de diferentes cámaras apuntando a diferentes dispositivos o equipos. De acuerdo, así que después de añadir la cámara, ahora se puede ver que la cámara también está en la escena. Ahora lo que voy a hacer, ya he creado un espacio de trabajo de Grafana, así que voy a navegar a la Grafana, y allí yPuede ver en un minuto que ya he creado un espacio de trabajo. Y por cierto, para este espacio de trabajo, ya he configurado todos los permisos, de modo que pueda acceder a los datos de TwinMaker y al revés porque la aplicación está en el panel de Grafana. Así que aquí se puede ver lo que estoy haciendo. Ahora voy a crear un nuevo panel, añadir un nuevo panel, y puedo añadir diferentes paneles. Por ejemplo, en esta escena en particular, usted está viendo que el panel de series temporales está surgiendo y desde la consulta voy a seleccionar un historialPor entidad, y estoy seleccionando todas las entidades que he creado, como molino de viento, y el nombre del componente es WindMillMetrics. Así que ahora se puede ver los datos que son los datos simulados que vienen a este particular, a través de este molino de viento en particular se asigna a esta serie de tiempo. Muy bien, así que voy a aplicarlo y, pero esto no es suficiente. ¿Quieres ver esto en gráficos de una manera 3-D, derecho? Como sólo tener estas gráficas de línea no es suficiente. Así que lo que voy a hacer por mis operadores, operadores de planta, voy a añadir IoT TwinMaker sEl panel de visor de escenas, y lo nombraremos como, Windfarm, y de la misma manera, lo asociaré con la escena Windfarm que está llegando a través del IoT TwinMaker, y usted será capaz de ver esta escena en vivo en la pantalla. Así que lo que hice, seleccioné las mismas propiedades, y ahora se puede ver este molino de viento está en color verde. ¿Puede usted decirme por qué este molino de viento está en color verde? Porque los datos es, la velocidad del viento es más de un centenar. Así que si la velocidad del viento está bajando por debajo de cien, el color shPodría cambiar a otra cosa, y cambió a rojo. Muy bien, eso es todo para la demo. Voy a volver a PowerPoint. Así que puede implementar esta demo de CookieFactory en su cuenta hoy. Sólo siga este enlace de Github para más instrucciones. Basta con la fábrica ficticia. Hablemos de una fábrica real ahora. Para contarnos más sobre el enfoque de Nortvolt a la fabricación sostenible, quiero invitar a Marcus, pero primero vamos a ver este video inspirador que introduce la visión de Nortvolt. - [Narra]La demanda de electrificación y la demanda de baterías de iones de litio está creciendo tan rápido que vamos a necesitar escalar la producción a un ritmo realmente increíble. - [Narrador 2] Estamos construyendo una de las plantas de baterías más grandes de Europa. - [Narrador 3] El siguiente paso está más allá de la construcción de más baterías, también está construyendo baterías más verdes, - [Narrador 1] y reciclaje, trayendo de vuelta la mayor parte de la capacidad. - [Narrador 4] Esas baterías se están convirtiendo en nuevas materias primas para la próxima generación de baterías.- [Narrador 1] Ya teníamos un equipo de clase mundial. - [Narrador 3] Se centra en invertir en un futuro sostenible, la construcción de una economía totalmente circular. (música inspiradora) (birds gorping) (música optimista) (trill eléctrico) - Gracias Sajid. Mi nombre es Marcus Ulmefors, y trabajo con la plataforma de datos para las fábricas de Northvolt. Estoy encantado de compartir nuestra historia con todos ustedes aquí hoy. Antes de hablar de escalar las fábricas digitales para la fabricación de baterías, quiero cubrir algunos antecedentes aAsí que en 2022, la primera mitad de 2022, la cuota de mercado global alcanzó más del 9%. Esto está excluyendo híbridos, totalmente eléctricos solamente. Ahora vamos a utilizar los mismos números, pero con una característica adicional. Mapeando a la derecha aquí, tenemos la capacidad global de fabricación total de baterías de litio. Así que para apoyar el 6% de la cuota de mercado mundial de vehículos eléctricos, en 2021, la producción de baterías de hierro de litio fue de 300 gigavatios horas.Eso es suficiente para construir 15.000 vehículos eléctricos y totalmente cargados. Esa energía eléctrica es suficiente para conducir 6 millones de kilómetros. Eso es 150 vueltas alrededor del ecuador. Ahora, así que vamos a hacer una pequeña predicción hacia el futuro, extendiendo esto a 2030. Entonces, ¿quién cree con este desarrollo que vamos a necesitar más de mil gigavatios horas por año para 2030? Bien, genial. ¿Qué tal más de 2000, ¿verdad? Resulta que vamos a necesitar aún más. Así que expertos de la industria. Normalmente hablo de números superiores a 4Ahora suponiendo que una gigafactoría grande tiene una capacidad de 30 gigavatios por hora, eso significa más de 100 gigafactorías antes del final de la década. ¿Qué impulsa estos números? Hasta ahora, he hablado de vehículos eléctricos, eso es un ejemplo visible obvio, pero necesitaremos electrificación y baterías de litio.Para hacer suficientes baterías y fábricas para satisfacer esta demanda, tendremos una carrera contrarreloj. Bienvenidos a Skelleftea. Esto es un viaje de ocho horas al norte de Estocolmo, la capital de Suecia. Este es un sitio para la primera gigafactoría de Northvolt. La fábrica se llama Ett, que es sueca para uno. Completamente construido, esto tendrá la capacidad suficiente para alimentar un millón de vehículos eléctricos por año.En diciembre de 2021, montamos nuestra primera venta de baterías, y en 2022, hicimos nuestras primeras entregas a nuestros clientes. Esto es real ahora y es sólo el comienzo. ¿Qué tiene de especial Northvolt y esta fábrica? Comencemos con la energía. Esta ubicación se elige deliberadamente para el acceso a energía 100% renovable de los ríos cercanos y el viento. También es una manifestación para la inversión estratégica en la integración vertical.En otros sitios de Northvolt, diseñamos, fabricamos y operamos paquetes o sistemas de baterías, y al final de la vida útil, los paquetes de baterías son esencialmente minerales de alto grado, y eso es perfecto para el reciclaje. Por eso, ya estamos construyendo una planta de reciclaje a escala de giga en el mismo sitio, y la producción de este proceso de reciclaje se alimenta de nuevo en el material activo.Así que ahora, básicamente estamos cerrando el bucle con esta co-ubicación, así que cerrando el bucle de fabricación circular, y reemplazamos la cadena de suministro global estándar con una caminata de cinco minutos. La integración vertical es ideal para la sostenibilidad, y también abre la puerta para el intercambio de datos flexibles entre los eslabones de la cadena de valor que permite un modelado más sofisticado y una visión más profunda. Imagine no sólo hacer las baterías más verdes del mundo, sino también el mundo más inteligente.Ahora, antes de hablar de escala, vamos a cubrir tres aspectos de la arquitectura técnica. Comenzando con el monitoreo y luego los controles y la plataforma de datos. Comenzaremos con hablar de las fuentes de datos y el monitoreo fundamental. En un entorno de fabricación, interactuamos con equipos que no están diseñados para comunicarse a través de Internet. Muy a menudo nuestra fuente de datos es un PLC, que se especializa en el control de equipos mecánicos.rts camino a la izquierda con el IoT Gateway, que es un ordenador de borde que ejecuta nuestra propia división Linux basada en Yocto. Correr en esa puerta de enlace, tenemos el software de mapper, que proporciona una abstracción para el equipo que nos ayuda a reducir la complejidad en nuestro entorno de nube. El mapper recopila datos sobre uno de nuestros inversores y protocolos de soporte. Por ejemplo, OPCUA, HTTP Rest, o SQL. Al bajar a la fila inferior, se ve cómo utilizamos el núcleo de IoT para generar certificados, de modo que no podemos autenticarnos a la correct cuenta y empezar a transmitir datos a las secuencias de datos de Kinesis. Hasta ahora he hablado de esta pasarela de IoT y mapper como un ordenador que ejecuta algún software. En realidad, esta plataforma IoT funciona en K3S y K3S es una distribución ligera de Kubernetes que está diseñada específicamente para estas cargas de trabajo de producción de IoT. Las pasarelas físicas de IoT son los nodos de los trabajadores en la fábrica, y el plano de control se ejecuta en la nube en nuestras cuentas AWS.Par de pasarelas IoT. Completamente construida, una fábrica típica tendrá miles de estas pasarelas, recopilando datos de millones de puntos de datos. El hardware real puede variar desde un pequeño dispositivo Raspberry Pi-like para la supervisión de la luz a máquinas más potentes para GPUs a bordo para ejecutar inferencias de modelos de aprendizaje automático en grandes conjuntos de datos. Por ejemplo, imágenes. Administrar software que se ejecuta en miles de dispositivos requiere reutilizabilidad y flexibilidad y personalización.Se etiqueta con su destino específico. Una vez revisado el código se fusiona, Launcher Fleet despliega los gráficos correspondientes del timón en el clúster K3S. Pods con el etiquetado lanzado ahora comenzará en las pasarelas correctas, comunicándose con el equipo de fabricación adecuado. Dentro del monitoreo, en términos generales, queremos resolver tres casos de uso. El primero es el monitoreo en tiempo casi real para levantar alertas y tomar decisiones rápidas. En segundo lugar, queremos hacer análisis de investigación en conjuntos de datos más grandes, tal vez datos de alta resolución queY en tercer lugar, queremos unir estos datos con datos contextuales dentro de la trazabilidad para hacer articulaciones flexibles y mejorar, por ejemplo, datos de eventos y procesos de larga duración. Así que esa es la ruta intermedia que se ejecuta en Kinesis, Lambda, RDS, PostgreSQL, y las herramientas de visualización como Grafana. Para investigaciones y análisis, utilizamos la fila superior aquí, donde repartimos datos brutos y almacenamos como archivos de Parquet optimizados, para que podamos servir a través de Athena para consultas más grandes. También podemos perform las juntas con datos contextuales para la misma ventana de tiempo usando Redshift. Monitoreo es el primer paso. Es un paso crucial, y ahora, vamos más lejos y empezar a interactuar con la fábrica. También se ejecuta aquí en un entorno de nube es software que controla las características y funciones críticas de nuestra línea de fabricación. Comenzaremos con la esquina inferior derecha con los sistemas de negocio, ERP y PLM. ERP, o Planificación de Recursos Empresariales, es donde usted tiene la gestión central de activos de la empresa, como efectivo e inventoPLM, Product Lifecycle Management, es la definición de un producto. Por ejemplo, una venta de baterías de un modelo específico. Esta es también la fuente de verdad para tolerancias de calidad, diseño de productos y procesos de fabricación. Ahora, consideremos un ejemplo donde todos estos sistemas interactúan.Las imágenes se toman y luego se analizan con algoritmos de visión computarizada para producir un evento con un resultado. Nuestro software de mapeo ahora toma esos datos y los transmite hasta Kinesis. Usando la información de orden de producción y los datos de evento, podemos ir a PLM y solicitar el plan de control de calidad correspondiente para este proceso para esta célula de batería. Ahora podemos validar que cada medición crítica está dentro de tolerancias definidas.Por ejemplo, si una medición está fuera de las tolerancias, se levanta una alerta de inconformidad y se guarda en el documento de trazabilidad de la célula de la batería. El equipo de calidad ahora tiene el mandato de decidir si desechar o no la célula o si se libera más. Esta decisión se registra en la parte superior derecha donde se ve el propósito construido web y moAplicaciones de bilis. Se comunican con un motor a través del gran punto final gráfico. Ahora, ¿qué sucede si un material no conforme procede en la línea de fabricación? Bueno, el equipo conocerá el id de material. Así que podemos pedir un servicio en la nube a través de la puerta de enlace API en la parte inferior izquierda, si se permite o no el procesamiento adicional. Si la respuesta es negativa, las operaciones se detendrá. Cada interrupción y desviación de calidad se captura y registra en tiempo casi real. Un acceso instantáneo a estos datos nos permiteEn esta arquitectura, se ven cuatro lambdas. En realidad estos son patrones de comunicación e integración. Y como corremos muchas aplicaciones paralelas, hay bastantes ejemplos más de ellos. Así que para una sección de la fábrica, ¿cuántos lambdas crees que tendremos aquí? Tal vez 20? Tal vez 40? Hoy en día, hay más de cien. Así que aquí, tienes algunos ejemplos de cómo el software en la nube utiliza los datos en tiempo casi real para automatizar y controlar nuestra fabricación.Por supuesto, también tomamos una copia de estos datos, los almacenamos, los refinamos para conducir el análisis. Y para eso vamos a echar un vistazo más de cerca a la plataforma de datos. Los datos son estratégicos en Northvolt. Comienza con la trazabilidad, que esencialmente nos permite rastrear exactamente lo que sucede a cada componente de célula en cada proceso de fabricación. Los datos de alta resolución constituyen de fábricas, y los laboratorios constituyen un activo único que podemos utilizar para optimizar las operaciones y para desarrollar mejores productos.Así que necesitamos una plataforma de datos flexible y escalable que nos pueda proporcionar la tecnología que necesitamos para monitorear análisis, ciencia de datos y aprendizaje automático. Administramos cientos de conjuntos de datos en la plataforma de datos hoy en día, y aquí vamos a ver tres categorías de flujos de datos que están específicamente diseñados para impulsar el análisis y para operaciones impulsadas por datos.e Datos contextuales. Estos datos provienen de la línea de fabricación, de equipos o de aplicaciones de software que se ejecutan en la nube, con o sin el humano en el bucle. Esto puede ser flujos de eventos inmutables o datos mutables como estados o identidades. Cada operación correcta a DynamoDB se consume a través de la captura de datos de cambio para flujos de DynamoDB. A continuación, tomamos estos cientos de conjuntos de datos y los filtramos y mapeamos y luego nos unimos con otros conjuntos de datos para crear estos conjuntos de datos diseñados específicamente para análisis.Los conjuntos de datos de e analytics son usados por técnicos, ingenieros y gerentes para priorizar iniciativas, hacer un seguimiento del progreso e informar sobre los resultados. Usamos un patrón ELT con Extractor S3, cargar en Redshift, y transformar dentro de Redshift usando DBT. Todo orquestado usando Airflow. La fila inferior representa mediciones eléctricas. Así que de células listas en un laboratorio, estos son datos de series temporales con alta resolución y larga duración, pueden ser muchos meses. Y usamos estos datos para hacer análisis de rendimiento y realizar product R & D. En la fila superior, subimos imágenes y otros archivos grandes directamente a S3. Esto puede ser, por ejemplo, fotos o imágenes de cámara de la línea de fabricación que nos permite entrenar modelos de aprendizaje automático para sistemas de detección de defectos basados en visión. A continuación, utilizamos entrenamiento distribuido con múltiples GPU en la nube e implementamos los modelos más performantes en las pasarelas IoT con GPU a bordo, para inferencia en la línea de fabricación. Así que esas son nuestras características fundamentales de la arquitectura que ejecutamos en AWS.Esto nos permite usar la estrategia de Cloud Native y Serverless. ¿Cómo diseñamos esto? ¿Cuáles son nuestros principios? Las gigafactorías son grandes inversiones, miles de millones de dólares. Eso significa que cada minuto de inactividad es muy caro.Larity para disminuir el radio de explosión. Y luego para escalar rápidamente, utilizamos muchos servicios excelentes proporcionados por AWS para red y computación y almacenamiento, pero también necesitamos manejar la complejidad de un sistema en crecimiento. Así que necesitamos ser capaces de combinar y equilibrar la reutilizabilidad global con optimizaciones específicas del sitio. Para escalar un plano digital, necesitábamos ser modulares, un concepto único en todas las fábricas sin sacrificar la capacidad de crear optimizaciones para una fábrica o área específica. Y la señorita de Northvoltion, que una admisión, es crear la batería más verde del mundo. Así que utilizando AWS, podemos utilizar tecnologías optimizadas para la nube y no menos importante, la utilización flexible de los recursos compartidos. Por ejemplo, usando Serverless. Además de eso, la región de Estocolmo EU North 1 funciona con una energía 100% renovable, que se adapta perfectamente a nuestra misión. Con una plataforma de alta calidad, fiabilidad y velocidad de desarrollo pueden coexistir.aning debemos apoyar implementaciones azules/verdes y despliegues canarios. Teniendo todo esto en cuenta, ¿dónde terminamos? Presentando módulos de Northvolt Cloud Factory. Comenzamos con un diseño físico de una fábrica. Luego creamos una cuenta de edificio dedicada para comenzar a desplegar el clúster K3S con cientos de gateways de TI. Y aquí es donde los mapas autentican la cuenta de edificio correcta y comienzan a ingerir datos en secuencias de datos de Kinesis. Aquí también es donde se ejecutará el back end Lambdas que buscamosPor ejemplo, DynamoDB para datos transaccionales operativos, pero también instancias RDS, Elastic Kubernetes Service, OpenSearch y la industria de datos en bruto. La cuenta de datos es donde refinamos los datos, internamente estos conjuntos de datos, aquí encontraremos Redshift y Airflow y DBT, pero también la plataforma MLOps. Puede pensar en esta cuenta entera como un DAG, con datos reproducibles desde la fuente, y también con datos en generPor ejemplo, la cuenta de acciones. Aquí es donde ejecutamos las características que ayudan al desarrollo y a las operaciones. Gestionamos Secretos, Registro de Contenedores Elásticos, y nuestra plataforma de observabilidad. Por ejemplo, encuestas de OpenSearch, Prometheus, y Grafana. Red. La columna vertebral de la red tiene pasarelas de tránsito, cortafuegos, y directo connec.t. Esto conecta no sólo nuestros sitios físicos, sino también los controles, los datos entrantes y salientes entre nuestras cuentas AWS. Y esta cuenta también proporciona la integración con otros proveedores de la nube, que permanecerán sin nombre hoy. (risas de audiencia) Y en una cuenta global, tenemos un punto final gráfico central, proporcionando como experiencia de usuario final frontal consistente para nuestras aplicaciones. El motor se accede a través de un punto final federado específico de fábrica que se ejecuta en la cuenta principal.Bien, ahora tenemos nuestra primera fábrica. ¿Hemos terminado? No. Escalamos. Necesitamos más fábricas. Así que vamos a añadir una más, y aquí creamos las mismas integraciones para en las cuentas globales, y añadimos la plataforma de datos del núcleo. La verdadera fuerza del concepto es visible en las cuentas del edificio porque aquí, dependiendo de la ubicación geográfica y el producto que hagamos conducirá diferentes procesos y por lo tanto diferentes tipos de construcción. Con el módulo de fábrica de la nube.Para lograr fiabilidad y un rendimiento optimizado a escala, necesitamos herramientas excelentes para la infraestructura como código. A medida que la tecnología avanza hacia todo como código, ¿qué se convierte en nuestra visión? Probablemente ya lo adivinó, fábrica como código. ¿Por qué no algo así? El mundo necesitará cientos de nuevas fábricas de baterías para que podamos pasar a un futuro energético más limpio. En Northvolt,Gracias por escuchar nuestra historia hoy. Espero que se queden con nosotros para el futuro emocionante. Tal vez ya el miércoles o el jueves en una de las conversaciones de tiza profunda con mis colegas. Con eso, quiero dar la bienvenida a Sajid de vuelta al escenario, y muchas gracias. (audiencia aplaude) - [Audiencia Miembro 1] Asombroso. - Gracias, Marcus. Estamos encantados de apoyar a Northvolt en sus esfuerzos para descarbonizar la energía para un futuro más verde.tiempo perfecto para agarrar su cámara de teléfono y tomar una foto de esta y algunas de las siguientes diapositivas.

            "I'm a Solutions Architect at AWS. With me, I have Marcus Ulmefors, Director Data and Machine Learning Platforms at Northvolt. You will meet Marcus very soon. Both me and Marcus are from Stockholm, Sweden. There is a special term for this called \"Tab-tsundoku\" I expected every one of you to raise your hands. You know why? Just like security, sustainability is everyone's responsibility. Let's look at the agenda. Today, you will learn how manufacturers can use data to become more sustainable. What are some of the modern technologies you can use to optimize factory operations? I will also show you a short demo of AWS IoT TwinMaker. greenhouse gases trap heat in earth's atmosphere that in return, makes the planet much hotter. There are many different greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and many more. The collective term \"greenhouse gases\" goes by the more scientific name called carbon dioxide equivalent. the 10 gigaton is 10 stacks of elephants stretching from earth to the moon, and we don't have to wait until the end of the century to see the consequences of the climate change. For example, this year around 33 million people, including 16 million children, have been impacted in my native country, Pakistan, by the devastating flood caused by climate change . there is no sign of fresh water, just the stagnant, contaminated water, acting as a fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy for industry. The manufacturing industry contributes significantly to greenhouse gases, and use, and manufacturers use a lot of water and energy. That's the reason, I mean, manufacturing are also the most targeted industry in sense of sustainability. We are experiencing the fourth industrial revolution live. The first revolution brought mechanical innovations, like steam engine, cotton spinning, and railroads. The fourth revolution brought the mass production through assembly lines and electrification. ISA95 is the international standard for the integration of enterprise and control systems, which is a traditional model before the cloud era. This model consists of field and control and management levels. The management level consist of basic control systems like supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, and programmable logic controller and distributed control systems. So historically, this monolithic model was good before the clouds and edge computing era, and it created data silos, and integration With the cloud and open platform communication unified architecture, the traditional model has evolved significantly, and IT-OT divide is minimized, and operations technology environments are leveraging more IT solutions in the cloud to improve productivity and efficiency of production operations. And why did they do this? To run latency critical system on the edge close to the factory floor where all the action happens, and send volumes of data to the cloud for analytics, BI, and machine learning operations. There are a predictive maintenance can increase production line availability by 5-15% and reduce maintenance costs by 18-25%, according to McKinsey . with predictive maintenance, you can improve overall equipment efficiency, OEE, and lifespan of a machine even further, more than even 22 years. So digitization enhances shop floor safety as well. only 39% of manufacturing executives said they were able to scale a use case outside of a single product's production process . only 44% said recent modernization efforts have provided them with actionable data, while 19% have not harnessed any data inside, and I'm going to focus on just a few AWS services that fast track adding digitization to your factory . So today, industrial companies want to ingest, store, and analyze IoT data closer to the point where data is generated, where all the action happens, which is the factory floor. So why they wanna do that, to enable predictive maintenance, improve overall equipment efficiency and enhance worker safety and even more things. So, here is a subset of the purpose built AWS services, to support industrial customers to build smart factory capabilities. Imagine a digital twin of a smart home, with interconnected sensors, and IoT devices collecting data about physical items in the home, allowing you to visualize and control security, access temperature, lighting, and other home appliances remotely. With the digital twin, you can improve the physical twin through rich data insights and leverage infinite opportunities to simulate proactive and reactive changes. So let's see how AWS defines it. You do this to monitor and reduce energy and water consumption, In order to have a proper digital twin, you need time series IoT data sensors, video data from camera feeds, and data from a variety of other home appliances, like dishwashers, washing machines, and what have you. You would even need 3-D visualization or 3-D drawings of your home in order to visualize and operate things in their natural context. What happens when you replace your old 4-D machine with the new one? Imagine the magnitude of work that will go AWS IoT TwinMaker provides you a workspace, which is a top level container for your digital twin application. It also serves as a security boundary to manage access to the application and its resources. So, you get tools to model your system by using an entity component model knowledge graph. So entities are digital representations of the element in a digital twin. They can be a piece of physical equipment, a concept or even a process. you can use building connectors or create your own connectors if required. You can use existing 3-D models and drawings combined with entities and components to augment a three dimensional representation of your digital twin and then view it in Grafana dashboard. So here, you see I'm logged into the AWS console, and I have already configured a couple of workspaces in the IoT TwinMaker that is available in the GitHub for you that you can You can represent an entire factory floor as a scene, and you can have as many scenes as you want to create a digital twin. And there are obviously a lot of entities pre-created for this demo that you can use. And obviously, I have imported some resources that we, 3D models and resources, that we will use to build this digital twin . IoT Maker supports GLTF format and other binary formats. So let's open the Cookie a factory operator is not logged into the IoT TwinMaker console, and they are not looking at the console all the time. So, developers can build Grafana application for the factory operators. For example, you can bring in video feed, Kinesis's video, through Kineis' video stream for your factory operators, so that they can see where action is taking place. I will remove this video feed, so that I can actually show you the same 3-D model that we have seen earlier in this view. So, this CookieFactory is running on the fossil fuel energy. They want to improve, they wanna have a better energy mix, and they want to implement windmills, wind farm. And as a developer, our job is to actually make this happen. So what we will do, we will create a digital twin So what I will do, I will quickly create an entity, give it a relevant name, for example Windmill 001, and after creating the entity, I'll associate a component with this entity, and this component is actually getting data from IoT SiteWise. So what will I do? I will just select that model name and the asset. So, what does this asset include? Very quickly. So as you can see, the model name is Windfarm, and within this windfarm model, I have associated an asset, which is Windmill 001, and what kind of measurements I am capturing is the speed. So here, I will use create scene option here, and obviously give scene a relevant name. So there are a lot of, you can create dashboards. So let's go back, and now we have the entity, I already imported I will import this GLTF Windmill, and obviously it's too small, so what I will do, I will click it and scale it to appropriate size, so that you can see actually how does it look like. So what I would do from the settings, I would actually set up the environmental preset and make it neutral. I could also use a 3-D light on this device, but again, if you have a lot of 3-D graphics, you So what I will do, I will add a model shader, and I will attach the entity, so that we can change the color of certain models based on some parameters, some thresholds, so let's see that in action. So what will I do, the entity we created earlier, that Windmill 001, will attach it to this windmill, and what I'm interested in the speed property, which is by the way, the only property we have if the speed is greater than or equal to 100, show this here in different color. For example, in this case, I choose the green color. So that means speed of wind is good enough, and we are getting good electricity. All right, other than that, we can also create virtual cameras that are pointing to certain devices, so that operators can reach directly to that place very quickly. Now what I will do, I have already created a Grafana workspace, IoT TwinMaker scene viewer panel, and in the same way, I associate it with the Windfarm scene that is coming through this particular windmill. So here you can see what I'm doing for my operators, plant operators, and plant operators. Now I will create a new dashboard, add an existing panel, so that I can access to the Grafana dashboard, and I can add different panels. For example, in this particular scene, you are seeing if the speed of the wind is going down below a hundred, the color should change to something else, and it changed to red. So you can deploy this CookieFactory demo in your account today. Just follow this Github link for more instructions. Let's talk about a real factory now. Next step is beyond building more batteries, it's also building greener batteries, - [Narrator 1] and recycling, bringing as much of the capacity back. Those batteries are then becoming new raw materials for next generation of battery production. This is focusing on investing into a sustainable future, building a fully circular economy. In 2021, the production of lithium iron batteries was 300 gigawatt hours. That's enough to build 15,000 electric vehicles and fully charged. That electrical energy is enough to drive 6 million kilometers. And that's 150 laps around the equator. So let's make a little prediction towards the future, extending this to 2030. So what drives these numbers? So far, I talked about electric vehicles, that'll need electrification and lithium This is an eight hour drive north of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. This is a site for Northvolt's' first gigafactory. The factory is called Ett, which is Swedish for one. Fully built out, this will have enough capacity to power one million electric vehicles per year. The buildings you see in this image represent one quarter of the full appliance capacity. We are building already a giga scale recycling plant at the same site, and the output of this recycling process feeds back into the active material manufacturing. So now we, we are basically closing the loop with this co-location, and we replace the standard global supply chain with a five minute walk. Vertical integration is great for sustainability, and it also opens the door for flexible data sharing between links in the value chain that enables more sophisticated modeling and deeper insight. Let's IoT Gateway is an edge computer running our own Yocto-based Linux division. Running on that gateway, we have the mapper software, which provides an abstraction for the equipment that helps us reduce complexity in our cloud environment. The mapper collects data over one of our support investors and protocols. For example, HTTP Rest, or SQL. We have a main repository where every release is tagged with its specific destination. Once reviewed code is merged, Launcher Fleet deploys the corresponding helm charts to the K3S cluster. For investigations and analytics, we want to solve three use cases. The first is near realtime monitoring for raising alerts and making fast decision. ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning, is where you have central management of company assets, like cash and inventory. It's also where you'll see transactions for purchase orders, production orders, and sales orders. This is also the source of truth for quality tolerances, product design, and the manufacturing processes. Now, let's go further and start interact with the factory. Using production order information and the event data, we can go to PLM and request the corresponding quality control plan for this process for this battery cell. This process runs serverless in Kinesis, Lambda and DynamoDB. The quality team now has the mandate to decide whether or not to scrap the cell or if it's released further. Data is strategic at Northvolt. It starts with traceability, which essentially allows us to track exactly what happens to every single cell component in every manufacturing process, and labs constitute a unique asset that we'll have right away on the manufacturing line. This architecture uses data in near real time to automate and control our manufacturing processes. In this architecture, you see four lambdas. In reality these are communication patterns. we manage hundreds of data sets in the data platform today, and here we're going to look at three categories of data flows that are specifically designed to power analytics, data science, and machine learning. Here we've looked at three types of data flow that are designed specifically for data driven operations. This data comes from the manufacturing line, from equipment or from software applications running in the cloud, with or without the human in the loop. Every right operation to DynamoDB is consumed We use an ELT pattern with Extractor S3, load into Redshift, and transform within Redshift using DBT. Everything orchestrated using Airflow. The bottom row represents electrical measurements. This data can be, for example, photos or camera images from the manufacturing line that allows us to train machine learning models for vision based defect detection systems. We then deploy the most performant models onto the IoT gateways with onboard GPUs. So let's go onto scaling. To scale a digital blueprint, we needed to be modular, a single concept across factories without sacrificing the ability to create optimizations for a specific factory or area. So there we need to be able to combine and balance the global reusability with site-specific optimizations. For example, the Stockholm EU North 1 region runs on a 100% renewable energy, which fits our mission perfectly. Introducing Northvolt Cloud Factory modules. We start with a physical layout of a factory. We then create a dedicated building account to start deploying the K3S cluster with hundreds of IT gateways. Here's where the maps authenticate the right building account and start ingesting streaming data into Kinesis data streams. This is also where the back end Lambdas will run that we looked at before. In the core account, we use functionality for features that In a global account, we have a central graphical endpoint, providing like consistent front end user experience for our applications. The backend is accessed through a factory specific federated endpoint running in the core account. This enables access control through user roles and location. The real strength of the concept is visible in the building accounts because depending on the geographical location and the product that we make will lead different processes and therefore different building types. The world will need hundreds of new battery factories for us to transition to a cleaner energy future. This is real now, and we are just getting started. We are happy to support Northvolt in their efforts to decarbonize the energy for a greener future. if your schedule is not fully booked, here are some of the sessions you should attend. You might already have some of these sessions in your schedule. Also, don't forget to attend the Chalk Talk with Northvolt on Wednesday, 12:15 PM.\n"

            "In this Level 300 breakout session, Muhammad Sajid, a Solutions Architect at AWS, discusses how manufacturers can leverage AWS to become more sustainable. He highlights the importance of sustainability and the impact of greenhouse gases on global warming. Sajid also introduces Marcus Ulmefors, Director Data and Machine Learning Platforms at Northvolt, who shares their experience of using AWS to operate a connected factory for sustainable battery production. The session includes topics such as using data to optimize factory operations, modern technologies for sustainability, and a demo of AWS IoT TwinMaker. Sajid concludes by providing call to actions and learning resources for attendees. The manufacturing industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. However, with the advent of the fourth industrial revolution and the integration of data and cloud technology, there is an opportunity to improve sustainability and profitability in manufacturing. The traditional model of separating operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) is being replaced by a more integrated approach. The ISA95 framework, which previously divided manufacturing technology into OT and IT, is evolving with the use of cloud computing and open platform communication. This convergence of IT and OT allows for improved productivity and efficiency in production operations. Sustainable manufacturing is made possible through modern technologies that allow manufacturing customers to use data to become more sustainable and profitable. Examples include lowering energy usage through occupancy detection and smart lighting, implementing predictive maintenance to increase production line availability and reduce maintenance costs, and enhancing shop floor safety through data monitoring. Data is the key enabler for sustainable manufacturing, but realizing value from data can be challenging. AWS offers services such as AWS IoT and ad services, as well as cloud capabilities at the edge, to help industrial companies digitize their factories and gain insights from their data. AWS IoT TwinMaker is a tool that allows users to easily create digital twins of real-world systems, such as buildings, factories, and industrial equipment. It provides a workspace for modeling the system using an entity component model, which includes entities, components, and relationships between them. Users can use existing data from multiple sources and combine it with 3D models to create a holistic view of operations. This simplifies the process of building digital twins and allows for monitoring and improving operations with less effort. The IoT TwinMaker is a tool that allows users to create digital twins of physical assets or environments. These digital twins are three-dimensional representations that can be augmented with data and context using connectors. The tool supports various types of connectors, including building connectors and custom connectors. Users can also import existing 3D models and drawings to enhance their digital twins. The digital twins can be viewed and managed through the AWS console and can be integrated with Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring and analysis. The tool also supports hierarchical structures for entities and components, and users can run queries using a SQL query language called Particle. Overall, the IoT TwinMaker provides a comprehensive solution for creating and managing digital twins in various industries and applications. The challenge is to improve the energy mix of a CookieFactory running on fossil fuel energy by implementing windmills. The developer will create a digital twin of a windmill using a 3-D model and IoT SiteWise connector to capture wind speed data. The windmill model is imported and adjusted in size and lighting is added to enhance the visuals. Model shaders can be used to change the color of the model based on certain parameters. In this demo, the presenter showcases how to bring data together with a 3D model using IoT TwinMaker. They attach a model shader to an entity and use the speed property to represent the shader in different colors based on the wind speed. They also demonstrate how virtual cameras can be used to quickly navigate to specific devices or equipment in a 3D environment. Additionally, they show how to integrate the data from IoT TwinMaker into Grafana to create visualizations and dashboards. The demo concludes with a real-life example from Nortvolt, a sustainable manufacturing company, and their approach to scaling battery production. Northvolt is a company that is focused on building a sustainable future and a circular economy. They are scaling digital factories for battery manufacturing to meet the increasing demand for electric vehicles and energy storage. Their first gigafactory, located in Skelleftea, Sweden, is powered by 100% renewable energy and is designed for vertical integration, including battery chemistry production and battery pack recycling. This allows them to create a closed-loop system and reduce reliance on global supply chains. With their innovative approach, Northvolt aims to contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. The technical architecture for creating the world's smartest batteries involves monitoring, controls, and a data platform. Data is collected from manufacturing equipment through IoT gateways and a mapper software, which runs on a lightweight Kubernetes distribution called K3S. The data is then streamed into Kinesis Data Streams for real-time monitoring and stored in optimized Parquet files for analytics. The architecture also includes software for controlling manufacturing processes and integrates with business systems like ERP and PLM. The goal is to enable flexible data sharing and advanced modeling to enhance sustainability and insight. This passage describes how various systems and processes interact in a manufacturing environment, specifically in the production of batteries. The ERP system releases a production order, and the battery cell moves through different manufacturing steps. Computer vision algorithms analyze images of the battery cell, and the data is streamed to Kinesis. Using this data and production order information, the PLM system requests a quality control plan to ensure that measurements are within defined tolerances. If a measurement is outside of the tolerances, a nonconformity alert is raised and recorded. The quality team decides whether to scrap the cell or proceed with further manufacturing. Cloud services are used to determine if further processing is allowed for non-conforming materials. All interruptions and quality deviations are captured and recorded in real time, allowing for immediate course correction. The passage also mentions the use of lambdas, which are communication and integration patterns, with over a hundred instances in the factory. Data is considered strategic and is used for traceability, optimizing operations, and developing better products. A flexible and scalable data platform is used to manage the large volume of data generated in the manufacturing process. The data platform includes contextual data from the manufacturing line, which is filtered and mapped to create analytics datasets used for monitoring, analytics, data Northvolt, a company focused on creating sustainable batteries, utilizes a cloud-native and serverless strategy in their greenfield factories. They prioritize reliability and security by using compartmentalization and zero trust principles. To scale quickly, they leverage various AWS services while managing the complexity of a growing system. Their architecture includes modules such as K3S clusters, Kinesis data streams, Lambdas, DynamoDB, RDS instances, Redshift, Airflow, DBT, and an MLOps platform. They also have dedicated accounts for building, core functionality, data refinement, sharing features, and networking. The entire ecosystem is supported by features like Secrets management, Elastic Container Registry, and an observability platform. The speaker discussed the concept of a connected factory model, which involves using AWS services such as transit gateways, firewalls, and direct connect to connect physical sites and control incoming and outgoing data between AWS accounts. This model also integrates with other cloud providers and provides a consistent front-end user experience for applications. The backend is accessed through a federated endpoint in the core account, allowing for access control through user roles and location. The speaker also mentioned the scalability of this model, with the ability to add more factories and integrate them into the global accounts. The concept of \"factory as code\" was also mentioned, highlighting the importance of infrastructure as code for reliability and optimized performance at scale. The speaker emphasized the need for hundreds of new battery factories to transition to a cleaner energy future and expressed Northvolt's commitment to decarbonizing energy. Attendees were encouraged to check out additional resources and sessions related to the connected factory model and sustainability. \n"
